    <p>Last Updated August 7, 2023</p>
    <p>THESE TERMS OF USE INCLUDE A CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND REQUIRE BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. DETAILS ARE SET FORTH BELOW.</p>
    <p>This agreement (the "Terms and Conditions") is a legally binding agreement between you and Drinks Holdings, Inc. ("Company," "We," "Our" or "Us") as operators of the MineWine Shop website, and governs your access to, and its related social media pages, accounts, and mobile websites and applications, as applicable, owned or operated by or licensed to Us (collectively, the "Site"), and they govern any order you place through the Site and, as applicable, your use of the Products you purchase. Through use of the Site, We provide an opportunity to purchase wine, participate in Our wine club and purchase related products (collectively, the “Products”) from Licensed Entities (as defined below) in their respective states (collectively the "Wine Services"). From time to time, We may also offer you an opportunity to purchase wine-related accessories from Our marketing partners. By using the Wine Services, and by clicking the digital button to place an order on the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions and acknowledge and agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with Our Privacy Policy. The sale and delivery of orders purchased by you will be executed and fulfilled by licensed third-party entities that hold valid alcohol beverage licenses issued by state agencies allowing for the legal sale of the Products (the "Licensed Entities” or “Licensed Entity"). The Site is directed to adults aged 21 or older and you must be at least 21 years of age to make a purchase through the Site and to receive delivery of the Products purchased, and a valid government-issued ID will be required upon delivery. Your use of the Site is subject to these Terms and Conditions and all applicable laws. These Terms and Conditions may change at any time without prior notice. Any changes will be reflected on the Terms of Use page of the Site.</p>
    <h2>MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENT</h2>
    <p>If you use the Site, you represent and warrant that you are at least twenty-one (21) years of age. In no event shall you use the Site, the Wine Services, make a purchase or purchase a gift for someone else if you are under the age of 21, nor may you do any of the foregoing activities for the benefit, or on behalf, of any person under the age of 21. We may refuse to register any person, or service any order at any time, in Our sole discretion. By using the Site, including, without limitation, by participating in the Wine Services, you hereby agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. <h4>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE, DO NOT PLACE AN ORDER, AND DO NOT USE ANY PRODUCTS. THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY CLAIM AGAINST US TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN PROCEEDING IN COURT. THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO PROCEED WITH ANY CLAIM INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION.</h4></p>
    <h2>SALE OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES</h2>
    <p>Our role in the transactions contemplated by these Terms and Conditions is that of a marketer and service provider that enables you, the consumer, to purchase Products from Licensed Entities, and to participate in the Wine Services and/or any other product offerings on the Site. You acknowledge that all orders for Products you place through the use of the Site are processed and fulfilled by such Licensed Entities, as the actual sellers of wine, and not by Us. Any Products you purchase through the use of the Site from the Licensed Entities must be for personal consumption only and not for resale. In the unlikely event that a particular wine or Product is unavailable at time of shipping, the Licensed Entity may substitute a wine or Product of similar style and of equal or greater value in your shipment.</p>
    <h2>ACCOUNT REGISTRATION</h2>
    <p>To use the Wine Services and make a purchase, you will be asked to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, address, phone number, shipping address, email address, date of birth, and payment information (collectively, the "PII") as well as a password in order to make a purchase and create a personal account with Us (an "Account"). Please be sure to protect the confidentiality of the password you create for your Account.  By making a purchase from Us, you understand and agree that We may share information about you and your transaction with other companies for the purpose of processing your order including, but not limited to, vendor processing, fulfillment and shipping, credit card authorization, and fraud prevention. Please review Our Privacy Policy regarding the PII We collect, use and share, and the terms of such collection, use and sharing. You are responsible for, and agree to pay promptly, all charges to your Account including applicable taxes and purchases by you or anyone you allow to use your Account. You represent and warrant that all PII you provide in connection with registering your Account is complete, accurate and non-fraudulent, and that you are authorized to use the method of payment you provide in connection with your use of the Wine Services and the Site. We reserve the right to contact the service provider of your method of payment to conduct periodic security checks. You acknowledge and agree that you may never use another customer's Account without their prior approval. You also agree to review and update your Account as and when necessary to maintain the most current PII.</p>
    <h2>ORDERS</h2>
    <p>As part of the Wine Services available to you, you will have the opportunity to purchase Products. When you place an order for a Product, you will be asked to create an Account if you don't have one, or to log into your pre-existing account. All offers marketed to you pursuant to these Terms and Conditions are subject to availability. The Company and/or the Licensed Entities have the right to refuse any order that does not comply with your state's laws or for any other reason, and your payment will not be processed for such order. We shall not be liable for any errors or omissions in Product pricing or discounts offered to you, and in the event of any such error or omission, the Company and/or the Licensed Entities reserve the right to cancel such order(s) and refund any erroneous charges to you. The Licensed Entities reserve the right to change Product pricing and discounts offered at any time.</p>
    <h2>PAYMENT</h2>
    <p>Your credit or debit card will be charged immediately upon checkout. We will not process orders that attempt to use an incorrect, expired, or over-the-limit credit card. However, in the event such an order is processed, We reserve the right to collect funds for any uncollected transactions owed. If you fail to pay any fees or charges when due, or if a redelivery fee or restocking fee is imposed, We may charge such amount directly to the credit card identified in your Account and may suspend or terminate your access to the Wine Services. You shall be responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys' fees and collection costs, that We may incur in Our efforts to collect any unpaid balances from you. Your right to use the Wine Services is subject to limits established by Us and/or by your credit card issuer.</p>
    <h2>COUPONS, DISCOUNTS AND VOUCHERS</h2>
    <p>Each coupon, discount, voucher or other promotion (a “Promotion”) is governed by these Terms and Conditions and the applicable terms of the Promotion as communicated to you. Promotions may not be combined with any other offer, discount or promotion. If you purchased or received a voucher, follow the instructions on the voucher to redeem the Wine Services. Each voucher code may only be used once and may not be used in conjunction with any other offer, discount or promotion (including, but not limited to Promotions) unless the applicable advertisement expressly states otherwise. The voucher has two separate values: (a) the amount paid; and (b) the promotional value, which is the additional value beyond the amount paid. The promotional value of any such offer is not refundable unless expressly stated otherwise, or to the extent permitted by law, and will expire on the expiration date as stated. The amount paid will never expire and may be applied toward the purchase of Products offered and available at the time you redeem if the original Promotion specified on the voucher is no longer available. All Promotions are subject to availability and We reserve the right to change Product pricing and discounts offered at any time. Certain states do not permit Us to honor certain Promotions, discounts or vouchers, and such Promotions are void where prohibited by law.</p>
    <h2>SHIPPING & DELIVERIES</h2>
    <p>Please refer to Our Shipping Policy for specific information about the shipment and delivery of your order. In the case of inclement weather or unforeseen delivery complications, it may be necessary to make adjustments to your delivery schedule and We may delay delivery to avoid extremely hot or cold weather that may damage your purchase. If there will be a significant delay, a customer service representative or representative from the Licensed Entity or common carrier may call or email you to let you know the status of your delivery. We will deliver your order as quickly as possible when the conditions permit. If the delivery address you designate is located in an area that does not permit the delivery of alcoholic beverages to a consumer, We will ask you to provide an alternate, permissible delivery address. All shipments are delivered by a certified courier service and require the signature of an adult over the age of 21 with valid photo ID at the time of delivery. By signing for the package, the recipient is certifying they are at least 21 years of age. Any misrepresentation to the courier is unlawful, and any violation will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Please note that shipments will not be left at your door without a valid signature at time of delivery, and We are not able to ship to a post office box. If no authorized adult is available during the day to sign for delivery after multiple unsuccessful delivery attempts have been made, your shipment will be returned to Us as undeliverable. Shipping fees are non-refundable, and a $12 restocking fee may apply to shipments that are returned to Us. Therefore, We recommend the use of a business address to ensure prompt delivery if you know you won’t be at home to receive the delivery.  All orders placed pursuant to these Terms and Conditions are shipped by Licensed Entities. Title to Products shipped, and the risk of loss, passes from the applicable Licensed Entity to you upon the shipment of your order by the applicable Licensed Entity. The terms and cost of shipment may vary from order to order. You will be notified at the time of purchase as to the applicable shipping charges (if any) and taxes, which you will be responsible for paying. The Licensed Entities We work with do not ship to states, counties or cities where shipping wine is prohibited by law. The remittance of any and all federal, state, sales, use and excise taxes to the applicable state authority will be made by the applicable Licensed Entity related to such wine orders. Product availability and limitations on orders vary by state.</p>
